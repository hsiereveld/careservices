# Care & Service Design Principles

## Core Principles

**Implementation:**
- Clean, professional layouts
- Clear pricing and service information
- Prominent reviews and ratings

### 2. **Cultural Inclusivity**
Design for a diverse, international user base with varying cultural backgrounds and languages.

**Implementation:**
- Neutral, welcoming imagery
- Clear iconography that transcends language barriers
- Flexible layouts for different text lengths (translations)
- Respectful color choices across cultures
- Support for RTL languages where needed

### 3. **Service Discovery Priority**
Make it effortless for users to find and understand available services.

**Implementation:**
- Clear service categorization with visual cues
- Intuitive search and filtering
- Service provider profiles with key information upfront
- Location-based matching
- Smart recommendations

### 4. **Mobile-First Experience**
Design primarily for mobile users, then enhance for larger screens.

**Implementation:**
- Touch-friendly interface elements
- Readable typography on small screens
- Thumb-friendly navigation
- Fast loading times
- Offline-capable core features

### 5. **Conversion Optimization**
Guide users smoothly toward booking services while providing value at every step.

**Implementation:**
- Clear call-to-action hierarchy
- Minimal friction in booking flow
- Progressive disclosure of information

- AI-assisted decision making

## Design Guidelines

### Visual Hierarchy
1. **Primary Actions** - Bold, high-contrast buttons (teal #2d8484)
2. **Secondary Actions** - Outlined buttons with hover states
3. **Tertiary Actions** - Text links with subtle styling

### Information Architecture
1. **Progressive Disclosure** - Show essential info first, details on demand
2. **Scannable Content** - Use bullet points, icons, and white space
3. **Clear Navigation** - Maximum 7 items in main navigation

### Accessibility Standards
- **Contrast Ratio**: Minimum 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text
- **Focus Indicators**: Visible keyboard navigation
- **Screen Reader Support**: Semantic HTML and ARIA labels
- **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44px for interactive elements

### Performance Guidelines
- **Critical Path**: Hero section loads in <2 seconds
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without JavaScript
- **Image Optimization**: WebP format with fallbacks
- **Font Loading**: System fonts with web font enhancement

## Component Philosophy

### Atomic Design Structure
1. **Atoms** - Basic elements (buttons, inputs, icons)
2. **Molecules** - Simple combinations (search bar, service card)
3. **Organisms** - Complex components (header, service grid, chat widget)
4. **Templates** - Page layouts
5. **Pages** - Specific instances

### State Management
- **Loading States** - Clear feedback during async operations
- **Empty States** - Helpful messaging when no content is available
- **Error States** - Constructive error messages with next steps
- **Success States** - Positive reinforcement for completed actions
