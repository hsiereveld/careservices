> Spec: Professional Dashboard Enhancement
> Created: 2025-08-26

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive, mobile-first professional dashboard that empowers service providers to manage their offerings, availability, client communications, and earnings through an intuitive interface. This enhancement will reduce onboarding friction for professionals and improve service delivery quality by providing clear visibility into all aspects of their business on the platform.

## User Stories

### Professional Service Management

As a professional service provider, I want to easily create and manage my service listings based on templates or custom offerings, so that I can quickly start accepting bookings without technical complexity.

The professional logs into their dashboard and sees a clear service management section. They can browse pre-defined service templates for common offerings (cleaning, tutoring, handyman work, etc.) or create custom services. Each service includes title, description, pricing per unit (hour/service/day), service radius, languages offered, and category selection. They can activate/deactivate services, edit details, and see which services are getting the most views and bookings.

### Availability and Booking Management

As a professional, I want to manually set my availability and manage incoming bookings efficiently, so that I can maintain work-life balance while maximizing my earning potential.

The professional accesses a calendar view showing their availability and bookings. They can block out times when unavailable, set recurring availability patterns (e.g., "available Monday-Friday 9-5"), and manage buffer time between appointments. Incoming booking requests appear prominently with client details, service requested, and proposed time. They can accept/decline with reason, propose alternative times, and view their booking history with status tracking.

### Client Communication Hub

As a professional, I want to communicate with clients directly through the platform for each booking, so that all service-related discussions are documented and organized.

Each booking has its own messaging thread where professionals and clients can discuss service details, share updates, or handle questions. The dashboard shows unread message indicators, allows quick responses, and maintains conversation history. Professionals can send pre-booking confirmations, service completion updates, and follow-up messages, all within the booking context.
